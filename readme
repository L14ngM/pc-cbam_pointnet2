Code availability

The core implementation of the proposed PC-CBAM module and the PointNet++ baseline
(four Python files: my_utils.py, pointnet2_utils.py, pc_cbam.py, and pointnet2_cbam.py)
is available at: https://github.com/yourname/pc_cbam_pointnet2

Due to ongoing project and collaboration constraints, the full project code
(including data preprocessing, training scripts and the complete evaluation pipeline)
cannot be released at this stage. If the manuscript is accepted and the constraints allow,
we will consider releasing additional non-project-specific components in the future.
